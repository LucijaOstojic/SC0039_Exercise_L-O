# SC0039_Exercise_L-O
Script for the CSV assignment in Python course

The input file brca_cnvs_tcga-1.csv is a table of 1000 copy number varations in breast cancer samples
from The Cancer Genome Atlas. It contains 4 columns: Sample ID, chromosome, starting point of 
the segment and the end point of the segment. 

This script takes the input file and adds a new column that contains the length of each segment, 
and outputs a new file with 5 columns called brca_cnvs_tcga-1_output.csv.

For the script to run successfully, the input file is needed.
